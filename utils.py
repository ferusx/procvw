    Normalize the ps(1) TIME field into a consistent HH:MM:SS format.

    The TIME column from ps can appear in several slightly different
    formats depending on system state and process lifetime. This helper
    smooths out those differences so the rest of the application can
    rely on a stable representation.

    Supported input formats:

        - MM:SS        → interpreted as 00:MM:SS
        - H:MM:SS      → normalized to HH:MM:SS
        - M:SS.xx      → fractional seconds are discarded

    Any malformed or unexpected input is safely converted to "00:00:00"
    to avoid breaking output formatting.

    """
    Convert a process tree into a JSON-serializable structure.

    This function takes a hierarchical process representation and
    transforms it into a nested dictionary format suitable for JSON
    output or storage. Each process becomes a node containing both
    its own metrics and its relationship to child processes.

    The resulting structure mirrors the tree view used in the CLI,
    but is fully self-contained and safe to serialize.

    Key features:

        - Recursive tree construction
            Builds a nested structure starting from root processes.

        - Subtree CPU aggregation
            Each node includes total CPU usage across all descendants,
            allowing consumers to identify heavy branches.

        - Cycle and duplication protection
            Guards against malformed or unexpected process graphs by:
                * preventing infinite recursion (visited set)
                * ensuring nodes are only emitted once (printed set)

        - Depth limiting
            Respects --tree-depth to restrict how deep the structure
            is expanded.

    Args:
        roots:
            Root processes of the tree (typically PID 1 or top-level entries).

        children:
            Mapping of parent PID → list of child processes.

        args:
            Parsed CLI arguments controlling behavior (e.g. tree depth).

    Returns:
        List[ProcessNode]:
            A list of root nodes, each containing recursively nested children.

    Notes:

        - The structure is fully self-contained and does not rely on
          external references, making it safe for JSON export/import.
        - Subtree CPU values are cached to avoid redundant computation.

    This function bridges stored data back into the live processing pipeline.
    It supports both flat and hierarchical (tree-based) JSON formats, allowing

    Behavior:

        - Accepts JSON generated via --save
        - Supports both:

            * nested tree structures with children

        - Validates structure before processing
        - Reconstructs ProcessInfo objects for downstream use

    Processing flow:

        1. Load and parse JSON file
        2. Validate structure and required fields
        3. Detect whether data represents a tree or flat list
        4. Walk through entries (recursively if needed)
        5. Rebuild ProcessInfo objects with safe defaults

    Command handling:

        - Otherwise:
            → prefer short command name (comm), with fallback

    Error handling:

        - Missing file → immediate exit with message
